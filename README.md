# IgniteSections

This project currently contains the Ignite login screen. 

Tap in or outside of the fields to show and hide the keyboard and move the content
up or back down. 

The Ignite logo will move further than the rest of the content so that it actually leaves the screen.

Tap the login button to trigger the activity indicator, and tap anywhere outside to stop the animation.
